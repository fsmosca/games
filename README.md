# Game
This is a collection of over the board classical chess games. The games in the pgn files can be found under the pgn folder.

## Cleaning process

The PGN files are run on [pgn-extract](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/) program to add `PlyCount` tag values and detect errors in the files.
